**Hello World!** This is the first post on a collaborative website where we will be sharing our reflections as first year computer science teachers. We believe that knowledge is inherently constructed through our experiences in the world and through our interactions with others. We hope to create CS classes which build upon this understanding to offer learning experiences to our students which are both personally meaningful and practically rigorous.

We're glad you're along for the ride!
