Title: Who are we?

We're a group of three middle and high school computer science teachers in our first year of teaching computer science. We have varying stories, but they all intersect at a class at Stanford University call Beyond Bits and Atoms. Taught by [Paulo Blikstein](https://www.tc.columbia.edu/faculty/pb2755/) and members of the [Transformative Learning Technology Lab](https://tltlab.org/), the class challenged us to reconsider how technology impacts education and, even more basically, how we learn. Since then, we've (kinda) diverged onto different paths, but we still share an interest in computer science education and in developing a community of practice of computer science educators.

is a first year computer science teacher at the ISF Academy in Hong Kong. Through a partnership with the TLTL, Jacob's (and Jenny's) grade 9 computer science class is a pilot project for a [constructionist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructionism_(learning_theory)) computer science curriculum. Jacob is interested in the ways technology can seem magical - and thus inaccessible - to many users. Rather than seeing themselves as productive agents who can create, hack, and use technology, many people limit their interactions with technology to passive consumption. Jacob sees personally-relevant, critical computer science education as one step in creating a world where all people can wield technology for their benefit.
